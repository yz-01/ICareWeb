                        These HRDP Point Rewards Terms and Conditions (these “Terms and Conditions”) are provided to all HRDP account holders (“<b>You</b>" or “<b>Your</b>") by Human Resource Development Platform Sdn Bhd (“<b>HRDP</b>," “<b>our</b>” or “<b>we</b>”) solely for the purpose of promoting and offering the Point reward program (“<b>Program</b>") redemption offers to qualified HRDP members who have been approved to participate in the Program and to obtain a HRDP Point rewards account (“<b>Rewards</b>").                     </p>

                    <p>
                        You will earn and accrue points based on registration, referral and purchase activity and usage of Your HRDP Point Reward Account (as defined in the Agreement), according to the active point earnings scale which can be found on the HRDP website and APP. In addition to the standard point earnings scale, You may earn points as may be authorized by HRDP from time-to-time for special programs, promotions or transactions that may be offered for limited time periods and for which additional terms and conditions may apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Net Merchandise Purchases” means purchases of merchandise or services on the HRDP Point Reward Account, less any returned merchandise credits or service credits posted to the HRDP Point Reward Account. Net Merchandise Purchases does not include cash withdrawals or any associated fees, charges, traveler’s checks, money orders or associated fees, money transfers or other fees, gaming chips, or fees or premiums for coverage or insurance to protect the balances of a HRDP Point Reward Account holder’s HRDP Point Reward Account.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Merchants who accept the HRDP Point reward system are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with card brand procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. As such, even though a merchant may sell retail items that may be similar to retail items sold by another merchant, the merchants may not have the same merchant code, and therefore the purchases at the merchants may not be included in the same category for the purposes of earning points. Net Merchandise Purchases must be submitted by merchants using the identified merchant category codes to qualify for earning points.  We are not responsible for incorrectly coded transactions. Additionally, purchases made through third parties, including resellers, or using a third-party payment account may not be eligible for accruing points. HRDP reserves the right to remove merchants from the Reward Program in its sole discretion including when required by local laws, rules, or regulations. Questions concerning eligible transactions and what constitutes Net Merchandise Purchases will be determined in the sole discretion of HRDP.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The points You earn will be credited to Your Rewards on a daily basis when transactions post to your HRDP Point Rewards Account.  We encourage You to frequently review Your Rewards, accessible through the HRDP mobile application. Once posted to Your Rewards, these points are available to You should You choose to redeem them. There is no limit on the number of points You can earn each year. You cannot earn points during any period in which Your HRDP Point Reward Account is not open or is not in Good Standing (defined below). If it has been more than thirty (30) days since the transaction and points are not reflected on Your Rewards summary, please contact customer service. Inquiries must be made within sixty (60) days of the transaction.                     </p>
                    <p>
                        No points will be retroactively applied to Your Rewards for otherwise qualifying transactions occurring during any period in which Your HRDP Point Reward Account when you were not enrolled into this Program.  You will automatically begin earning points upon opening Your HRDP Account and enrolling in the HRDP Point Rewards Program, subject to HRDP approval of such enrollment request.

                    <p>
                        Rewards statements will be made available through the HRDP website or mobile application. Individual transactions forming the basis for awarding points will not be shown on the Rewards statement—only total points earned less any point reduction for refunds, returns or adjustments, redeemed points and expiring points will be displayed. The frequency, timing, content or layout of the Rewards statements are subject to change from time-to-time at the discretion of HRDP. Points cannot be combined with other discount or reward programs unless specifically authorized by us.                    </p>

Points have neither cash value, surrender value, transfer value nor any other value of any kind until and to the extent they are actually redeemed by HRDP. Points cannot be used to offset any amount due from You to Point on the HRDP Point Reward Account. Points used by You for redemption will be those unredeemed points that have been Rewards the longest time. Points earned by You may only be redeemed for a Redemption (a "Redemption Reward" or "Reward"). All redemptions are final. The sale or barter of any points, other than by HRDP, is expressly prohibited.                    </p>
